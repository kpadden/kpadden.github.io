<div class="about">
    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Kenneth (Kenny) Padden. I am a 4th year Cognitive Science Major at the <sub>University of California, San Diego</sub> as well as a four year Student-Athlete on Men's Rowing (2x team captain).</p>
    <p>I am very passionate about building things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Car Restorations</li>
        <li>Woodworking Projects</li>
        <li>Web Based Products</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I interned at Oath (Yahoo!) and Verizon Media (Yahoo!) as a product designer. Products I’ve undertaken significant roles with during these two internships were Verizon’s internal version of AutoML, Yahoo!’s pawned password check and new login flow (including research lab interviews and AB testing for 2FA), alternative logic for Yahoo!’s recovery channel obfuscation during account recovery, LastPass partnership upsells in Identity flows, and the complete redesign of Yahoo!’s Member Center!</p>
    <h2>Take Aways</h2>
    <p>I was fortunate to partake in a deep dive on Machine Learning early in my career. The work I completed in this category emphasizes technical research, intergration of machine learning use cases, and industry leading product development. Additionally, my work in automotive restoration has not been a contravention to iterative product design and delivery. I've learned more about research, road maps (no pun intended), and improvising real solutions during the individual journeys of each of the three cars I've restored.</p>
