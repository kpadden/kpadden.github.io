    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am Kenneth (Kenny) Padden. I am a 4th year Cognitive Science Major specializing in Design & Interaction as well as a four year Student-Athlete on Men's Rowing (2x team captain).</p>
    <p>I am very passionate about building things: Cars, Woodworking, and I’m getting more into FE Web Development. I interned at Oath (Yahoo!) and Verizon Media (Yahoo!) as a product designer. Products I’ve undertaken significant roles with during these two internships were Verizon’s internal version of AutoML, Yahoo!’s pawned password check and new login flow (including research lab interviews and AB testing for 2FA), alternative logic for Yahoo!’s recovery channel obfuscation during account recovery, LastPass partnership upsells in Identity flows, and the complete redesign of Yahoo!’s Member Center.</p>
