				<h1>Mobile Information System</h1>
				<h3>Overview/Background</h3>
				<p>After choosing Education & Work as the research area we will be focusing on for this project, we began Stage 1: Online “Secondary” Research. We first began by looking at existing apps and services we were already familiar with as college students. Slack, Canvas, TritonLink, and Piazza are services we have been using since before the quarantine has begun, and are still consistently used by many individuals.  Slack offers different “channels” for communicating and sharing files with others. Users can make seperate channels for separate groups and collaborators. Canvas is an academic platform used by students and professors to post and access course materials. TritonLink has been widely used by UCSD students. Some features offered are virtual advising, transcripts, and course planners. Piazza uses a forum-type format which allows users to ask questions and engage in discussions. Users have the option to ask and answer questions anonymously, encouraging more engagement unique to an online classroom discussion setting.</p>
				<p>Zoom has been increasingly used by many individuals and is quickly becoming the main platform for online video calling as quranatine has pushed many schools and businesses to be run remotely. There is a rise of security and privacy concerns with its widespread use. Some school districts have even banned the use of Zoom to conduct remote courses because of these issues. Skype and Google Meet are potential platforms recommended to alleviate these security issues.</p>
				<p>Hallway has been introduced as an app to work with Slack to imitate an office environment remotely by creating timed video chat “break rooms.” Users can take these short breaks in between work, as they would when they were working in an office, to socialize and catch up with co-workers.</p>
				<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>How might we help working from home adults experience the benefits of their work environment remotely given the lack of an office community culture?</p>
				<h3>User Research/Needfinding</h3>
				<p>We surveyed over forty students, IA’s, TA’s, Professors, and adults working from home adults to understand their schedules, work load, motivation, responsibilities, workspace, virtual tools, as well as collect open ended feedback on what has been going well and what has not been going well for them in the current situation.</p>
				<h3>User Personas</h3>
				<p>Student In Different Time Zone</p>
				<p>Name: Ishan</p>
				<p>Quote: “I can barely catch a break because as soon as I can sleep my parents wake up and want me to spend time with them. I’m struggling meeting my parents’ expectations, finishing my school work, and making time for myself”</p>
				<p>Descriptor: An international college student taking online classes from a different timezone than his university.</p>
				<p>Quick Take: Struggling to keep up with assignments and lectures. Time difference makes it hard to stay synchronous with other classmates. Pesky parents always invade his personal space. Having to allot time from his day to sit down and socialize with his family over meals that he used to use as a time to take a break and/or multitask.</p>
				<p>Key Goals: Staying motivated in school work despite the lack of structure. Keeping himself accountable to set aside time for his asynchronous classes while also attending his synchronous classes.</p>
				<p>Day in the Life: Ishan is a 19 year old Sophomore at the University of California, San Diego studying computer science. He is beginning to make the transition to upper division courses for his major. He is struggling with the lack of access to computer labs and real-time TA help as he works through assignments. Half his classes are also synchronous so his sleep schedule has been less than ideal. He has to stay up until 5 am for his mandatory MMW discussion session. He has to talk very quietly for breakout room discussions so he won’t wake up his parents. After ending the discussion session at 6 am, Ishan immediately falls asleep. Ishan needs to wake up at 8am to help his parents get groceries and essentials when the stores open.</p>

				<p>Professor with Children Teaching Remotely</p>
				<p>Name: Martha</p>
				<p>Quote: “It’s been a lot trying to make time for my students, my kids, and myself. I’m constantly swamped with zoom meetings that could have been addressed over an e-mail.”</p>
				<p>Descriptor: A mother of two, working from home as a professor trying to keep them engaged and motivated</p>
				<p>Quick Take: Tried to familiarize herself with online teaching platforms and its many features. Class time for children overlaps with her regular lecture, and office hours.</p>
				<p>Key Goals: Manage her own online workload, as well the online teaching curriculum for her younger children. Martha is now responsible for managing her own time and work deadlines, as well as that of her children.</p>
				<p>Day in the Life: Martha is a 34 year old mother of two (5 and 7 years old), working as a calculus professor for a large university. She has classes to teach every day from 10am-6pm with some gaps in between. She wakes up at around 7:30, to make breakfast for herself and ready something for her children, then starts her work at 9 AM. Her day is full of meetings, lectures, despondent students, and long hours staring at a computer screen, while juggling her time making sure her children are taken care of and not causing trouble.</p>

				<p>Working From Home Adult</p>
				<p>Name: Daniel</p>
				<p>Quote:“To game or to work...”</p>
				<p>Descriptor: A single working from home adult trying to balance his work and personal life at home</p>
				<p>Quick Take: Struggling with structuring his time for remote  work with his personal hobbies. Having difficulty shifting from an office environment for work to a home environment. Is not used to working with an unstructured schedule.</p>
				<p>Key Goals: Stay productive and on track with his projects for work while maintaining connections with his co-workers and clients. Also wants to increase his Twitch following when possible.</p>
				<p>Day in the Life: Daniel is a 32  year old single adult working from home. His meetings differ each day so his schedule remains inconsistent. His “work days” have become very loosely structured since quarantine has begun. It is difficult for him to balance working on his projects with his increased free-time from lack of consistent projects. His nights consist of Twitch livestreaming where he often loses track of time.</p>

				<h3>Competitive Audit</h3>
				<p>We compared our product with Hallway, Zoom, Slack, Google Meet, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Strava, Jira, Google Calendar, Trello, and Monday.</p>
				<h3>Storyboards</h3>
				<h3>Low-fidelity Prototypes</h3>
				<p>The low-fidelity prototypes were built out using Balsamiq to be able to rapidly put down sketches and test them in user flows. With premade drag and drop options, Balsamiq was the perfect tool to quickly iterate ideas and get a feel for the features we planned to include.</p>
				<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<p>We had people run through these tasks and give us their thinking out loud:</p>
				<p>Task 1: You want to go through the app and make sure that the information provided by the app is accurate. Go to your profile and check where you can edit this information.</p>
				<p>Task 2: You want to begin to add tasks for work so that the app can start keeping track of how much you have accomplished as well. Go and add a task to your in-app calendar.</p>
				<p>Task 3: You want to connect with a fellow co-worker, Joe Bob. Send Joe Bob a message through the app.</p>
				<p>Task 4: You and Joe Bob have both worked and deserve a break. Enter a break room with Joe Bob.</p>
				<p>Task 5: The rankings have closed, and you have done all that you can to rank as high as possible. Go check to see what rank you placed, and how much you managed to complete.</p>
				<p>We then followed up with these questions to further gather information from their experience:</p>
				<p>Was there anything you would change or improve about the app?</p>
				<p>Which features do you feel stand out most to you?</p>
				<p>What do you think the purpose of the ranking system is?</p>
				<p>Do you feel more motivated by competition against others or recognition from others?</p>
				<h3>Alternate Designs</h3>
				<p>Using this feedback we transitioned to using Figma and created the beginning of our high-fidelity prototypes</p>
				<h3>High-fidelity Prototypes</h3>
				<p>Our high-fidelity prototypes took share with consistent grid, superior prototyping, and plenty of overlay functionality</p>
